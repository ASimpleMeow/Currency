# Currency
A simple iOS currency conversion app written in Swift, using the Fixer.io API (http://fixer.io)

Used as a teaching assignment for students of Waterford Institute of Technology (http://www.wit.ie).


# Features I implemented
- Wired UI outlets and actions
- Four extra currencies - Russian, Japanese, Polish and South African
- Auto Layout
- Decimal keyboard, which clears existing text, has a done button and moves the screen up when editing and down when done editing
- Progress Bar instead of activity indicator
- Icons (with different sizes), Launch screen (blur effect with label), Nice colours on the UI and UI Icons
- Updated the depricated call when using Asych method
- Extra feature - Night mode/Constrast view for people who struggle to see the screen

# Code
The code has some comments I added (to the already existing comments), I replaced a switch statement in the GET request method with a for loop for cleaner code.
